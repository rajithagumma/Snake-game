## Snake Game

This repository contains the code for a simple Snake game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

### Features

* **Basic Gameplay:** Control the snake to eat food and grow longer.
* **Game Over:** The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
* **Scorekeeping:** Tracks and displays the player's score.

### Technologies Used

* **HTML:**  Provides the structure for the game canvas.
* **CSS:** Styles the canvas and the overall layout.
* **JavaScript:** Handles game logic, animation, and user input.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
   ```

2. **Open the index.html file in your web browser:**
   This will launch the Snake game.

### How to Play

* **Use the arrow keys:** Use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
* **Eat the red food:** The snake grows longer with each piece of food it eats.
* **Avoid the walls and yourself:** Hitting the walls or the snake's own body ends the game.

### Code Structure

The code is organized into three main files:

* **index.html:** The HTML file containing the canvas element and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
* **style.css:** The CSS file responsible for styling the canvas and overall game appearance.
* **script.js:** The JavaScript file containing the game logic, including snake movement, collision detection, and scorekeeping.

### Potential Enhancements

* **Speed Control:** Allow the player to adjust the game speed.
* **Game Over Screen:** Display a more informative game over screen with the final score.
* **Levels:** Introduce different levels with increasing difficulty or additional elements.
* **Sound Effects:** Add sound effects for eating food, game over, and other actions.

Bato.ai Integration:

Bato.ai was used to generate parts of the code, particularly in areas like game loop, collision detection, and object movement. This helped speed up the development process and provided a solid foundation for the game.

Future Enhancements:

Difficulty Levels: Add different difficulty levels that adjust the speed and food generation rate.
Power-Ups: Implement power-ups that grant the snake temporary abilities, like increased speed or invulnerability.
Multiplayer: Allow two players to compete against each other on the same screen.
